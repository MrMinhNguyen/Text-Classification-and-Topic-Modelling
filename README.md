# Text Classification and Topic Modelling Project #

**Part 1: Text Classification**

Two algorithms, namely Recurrent (RNN) and Logistics Regression (LR), are used to develop machine learning models that carry out text classification. In total, 24 models are developed, each configured differently by applying a specific text preprocessing method, being trained on a specific amount of data, and estimating a specific output variable. Their performances would be evaluated to find a more suitable method for this particular problem.

**Part 2: Topic Modelling**

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models are developed in order to provide different approaches of document clustering. The first approach takes into consideration bi-grams occurring within the documents and clusters them into 20 topics; whereas, the second approach only processes uni-grams and classifies documents into 10 topics. For each of the two aforementioned approaches, two models are developed using the small and large training datasets containing the first 1000 and 20,000 records of the original training dataset respectively.
